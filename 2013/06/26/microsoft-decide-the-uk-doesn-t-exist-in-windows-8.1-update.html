            <p>As you may of gathered from previous posts, it seems it isn’t possible to install the update on a UK surface. The only way that is rumoured to work is to flash the device and select either German or French in the setup. This is going way beyond my commitment to trying this so for the moment I am done.</p><p>As far as I can see there has been no official announcement from Microsoft about if or when there will be a fix, a rumour said July that is probably not far off. Is disappointing that no one noticed this issue and they didn’t make it clear that they were abandoning poor old UK.</p><p>So for the moment don't try, it will go no where no matter how many tricks you follow.</p><p><a href="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/close_surface_rt.jpg"><img width="240" height="180" title="close_surface_rt" style="display: inline;" alt="close_surface_rt" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/close_surface_rt_thumb.jpg"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The book is closed for me on my quest to get 8.1 early.</p><br /><a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/microsoft-decide-the-uk-doesn’t-exist-in-windows-81-update.aspx'>Stuart James</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/microsoft-decide-the-uk-doesn’t-exist-in-windows-81-update.aspx'>...</a>

                    <section>
                        <p>The company’s IT infrastructure I manage has been using Office 365 for over a year now, but have we? Office 365 gives access to a great Outlook Exchange hosted email, as well as optional Office subscriptions. The subscription costs a lot, but enables easy use of Office that is common in most companies. The flexibility on install makes it much easier in a company that has more computers than people.</p><p><strong>What the package should be is:</strong></p><ul><li>Email through Exchange</li><li>Document collaboration through SharePoint</li><li>Office desktop [Opt]</li></ul><p>As you may have noticed there is a SharePoint step that we miss, now I explain why Office 365 is broken. SharePoint I admit I have never fully understood but I know if used properly can have great integration with other Office product. As always there is a but though and this but I feel to be quite a big issue to a small business.</p><p>As companies develop from a single person to multiple people they go through one computer, to several computers, to several computers accessing shared storage. So most small companies quickly achieve a shared folder or pooled space style approach, to migrate this to Office 365 requires a learning step that is quite hard. The most logical way is to move your files to SharePoint so this could include Quotes, Accounts etc and here comes the but, most people would want to keep a fairly substantial back history to avoid having some files here and some files there creating a nightmare document version and backup scenario.</p><p>In Office 365 SMB you get 10gb of storage + 500mb per user, so 10 users a 15gb. If you are a new company that would be enough for a short time and you would quickly burn through and upgrade(will talk about soon). For an established company 10gb is probably not enough to even move one of there operating folders up so where do you go?</p><p>Sadly there is no answer, on SMB plan there is no way to pay for additional storage… I thought this would be fixed in the recent update but they have still left it as is. Oh and it gets better, there is no way to automatically update to an enterprise plan, and that is ignoring the increased cost. To upgrade you have to download your files and re-upload them (don't ask how file version histories work for that).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So what are you really getting?</strong> a service you can partially use and late software updates… It doesn’t sound like a way to keep people happy with your ecosystem. In fact it makes you wonder if it is worth moving over to LibreOffice and saving a very large amount of money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As I am saying far to often Microsoft great promise, yet just failing to get it just right.</p><br /><a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/why-office365-for-smb-is-broken-but-why-have-they-not-fixed-it-2013-05-22.aspx'>Stuart James</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/why-office365-for-smb-is-broken-but-why-have-they-not-fixed-it-2013-05-22.aspx'>...</a>

                        <p>After seeing the post come up in my sad to say Facebook feed went on to download the 8.1 update for my Surface RT. Am a little confused by how this error is to be fixed but still am a little disappointed. </p>

<p>Error “The update is not applicable to your computer”</p>
<p>Hopefully will fix a bit later, for the moment no 8.1 for me and many others.</p>
