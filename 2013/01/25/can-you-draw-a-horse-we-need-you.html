            <p>For Sketch based Video Retrieval often datasets are of equestrian horse events or snow boarding, one of the challenges that comes up is convincing people to draw for public viewing. Therefore I found this in my archives to help any perspective evaluators draw with confidence.</p>

                    <section>
                        <p>Today I had an interesting problem, due to dumping a lot of data down onto SkyDrive my local updates are running a little behind. So when I was faced with writing up a presentation for the Post-Graduate Conference I hit a problem moving between devices. After considering my options of downloading manually and uploading the completed power point I saw an interesting experiment that I could do to test the Surface RT. I aim to answer the simple question of:</p>
<p><strong><em>Is it possible to write a presentation on your surface?</em></strong></p>
<p>So I started editing the presentation which I started on my laptop, then quickly realised touch doesn't work. This isn't a major objection since there is the option of a touch pad or a usb mouse. Since I had a mouse to hand decided to use that, I am sure you could use the touch-pad but I'll go the like of least resistance.</p>
<p>To note to make it even slightly possible to do a power point or any office task on the Surface RT you need to download all the updates from the desktop mode windows update. Without the updates it is practically unbearable to even type in Word. Since the updates were available before consumer release don't take this as a negative to the Surface RT.</p>
<p>There are a collection of constraints you must consider when using the surface deciding to use PowerPoint on windows rt. The big one is, have you got all your images you are going to need? If the answer to this is no, then you are doomed before you begin. With no good way really of editing images on the RT it really isn't possible to do. You of course have the basic options within PowerPoint like crop etc, but these wont go far in creating really technical drawings.</p>
<p>The problem of assets is somewhat relieved by SkyDrive and its wonderful integration with Office 2013, this allows you to quickly and easily pull down images or videos you need and dump them in. There are some UI niggles I have with this on how it interacts, for example when you insert an image if you quickly go back to the insert image icon it wont remember where you are in sSkydrive or even that you were using SkyDrive to start with it will bring your right back to where online do you want to get this image from.</p>
<p>Oddly other than the resource issue I didn't hit much more some nice things you can do with snapping to organise your thoughts with the one note app allows you to think another time and write up when you are ready as can be seen below:</p>
<p><img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" title="Power Point Windows RT" alt="Power Point Windows RT" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/blogimages/powerpoint-rt/powerpoint_splitscreen.png" height="309" width="550" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So to answer the question, Yes it is possible but you must come prepared. I found myself having to go back to my desktop that I was sat in front of to shorten some videos and create some new images. The missing assets could of been dropped and would be a reasonable presentation, but with presentations unless you are a seasoned veteran it is unlikely you will be happy to go with a presentation that is "reasonable".</p>
<p>Having said all this if you are sure you have everything you need then jump on the train and you could put together and present (if you have a VGA accessory) when you get there without a problem!</p>
<p>I think this was a nice win for the Surface RT!</p><br /><a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/powerpoint-on-a-surface-rt-a-touch-to-far-2013-01-24.aspx'>Stuart James</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/powerpoint-on-a-surface-rt-a-touch-to-far-2013-01-24.aspx'>...</a>

                        <p>After having some weird connection issues over the last week since migrating my blog and portfolio to an alternative configuration instance based on Windows Server 2008 I decided to do a load test to see whether this was a bigger issue than I expected. The results I just cant explain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 align="left">Windows Server 2008, IIS Installed only with .NET4</h4>

<h4 align="left">Windows Server 2012, IIS Installed only with .NET4</h4>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">As can be seen from the 2008 graph the server fell over very quickly and took a very long time to recover. After looking at this went to the CPU load and found the answer:</p>
<h4 align="left">Windows Server 2008, IIS Installed only with .NET4</h4>
<p align="left"><a href="http://stuartjames.info/Journal/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/aws_win2008_cpuload.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="AWS_Win2008_CPULoad" border="0" alt="AWS_Win2008_CPULoad" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/aws_win2008_cpuload_thumb.png" width="642" height="276" /></a></p>
<h4 align="left">Windows Server 2012, IIS Installed only with .NET4</h4>
<p align="left"><a href="http://stuartjames.info/Journal/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/aws_win2012_cpuload.png"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="AWS_Win2012_CPULoad" border="0" alt="AWS_Win2012_CPULoad" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/aws_win2012_cpuload_thumb.png" width="642" height="275" /></a></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">This wasn’t the profile of the CPU when I first set up the instance, I have no idea what has caused the development of this maxed CPU issue. Will have to look into more, but for the moment am back on 2012! Does demonstrate the importance of setting up alarms though, another nice functionality on the AWS platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<h5>Maximum Load Test</h5>
<p>I have also done a max load test just to see how much the server could take, maxes out about 70 users. Tested against blog, so all img,js and css are additional calls wrapped into one user call. Granted when server hits max capacity is essentially unresponsive.</p>
