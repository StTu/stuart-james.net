            <p>Everyone has games they played from their childhood, well that iconic game for me was Drakkar. Mario, Sonic get honourable mentions but Drakkar from 12 to my early 20’s. At Christmas I decided to bring to my walls a little nostalgia, and purchased the Drakkar map set available from the <a href="https://www.drakkarzone.com/store/store.php">store</a>.</p> <p align="center"><a href="http://stuartjames.info/Journal/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/20130114_094129.jpg"><img style="background-image: none; border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px; padding-top: 0px" title="20130114_094129" border="0" alt="20130114_094129" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/20130114_094129_thumb.jpg" width="644" height="484"></a></p> <p>Today they arrived and couldn’t be happier!

                        <h4>This or That?</h4> <p>After many discussions about the contrast of running a VPS on a host provided dedicated server and running an Instance in the cloud this weekend I decided to explore and found that actually there aren't bad options available. Obviously the two big players Amazon and Microsoft have there offerings known as:</p> <p align="center"><a href="http://stuartjames.info/Journal/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/png.png"><img style="display: inline" title="png" alt="png" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/png_thumb.png" width="162" height="63"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://stuartjames.info/Journal/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/azure_small.png"><img style="display: inline" title="azure_small" alt="azure_small" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/azure_small_thumb.png" width="143" height="63"></a></p> <p>There are other offerings from over providers such as Rackspace, but for this article I will be looking at just these two since they are what I would consider top companies for the area of cloud services.</p> <p>So what can you get free to start with:</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <table style="color: #000000" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="47%"> <p>For the first 1 Year</p> <hr> AWS Free Usage Tier (Per Month):  <h6>Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)</h6> <ul> <li>750 hours of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon EC2</a> Linux<code>†</code> Micro Instance usage (613 MB of memory and 32-bit and 64-bit platform support) – enough hours to run continuously each month<code>*</code>  <li>750 hours of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2">Amazon EC2</a> Microsoft Windows Server<code>‡</code> Micro Instance usage (613 MB of memory and 32-bit and 64-bit platform support) – enough hours to run continuously each month<code>*</code>  <li>750 hours of an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancer</a> plus 15 GB data processing*  <li>30 GB of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ebs">Amazon Elastic Block Storage</a>, plus 2 million I/Os and 1 GB of snapshot storage<code>*</code></li></ul> <h6>Simple Storage Service (S3)</h6> <ul> <li>5 GB of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> standard storage, 20,000 Get Requests, and 2,000 Put Requests<code>*</code></li></ul> <h6>DynamoDB</h6> <ul> <li>100 MB of storage, 5 units of write capacity, and 10 units of read capacity for <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a>.**</li></ul> <h6>Relational Database Service (RDS)</h6> <ul> <li>750 hours of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/rds">Amazon RDS</a> Single-AZ Micro DB Instances, for running MySQL, Oracle BYOL or SQL Server (running SQL Server Express Edition) – enough hours to run a DB Instance continuously each month<code>*</code>  <li>20 GB of database storage  <li>10 million I/Os  <li>20 GB of backup storage for your automated database backups and any user-initiated DB Snapshots</li></ul> <h6>Simple Workflow (SWF)</h6> <ul> <li>1,000 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/swf">Amazon SWF</a> workflow executions can be initiated for free.

Well Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p> <p>I am looking to migrate my websites and services therefore VPS style instances are more useful to me than a specialised cloud. I feel which is best is very much dependent on your needs, I was looking for IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). Having said this a future planned Windows 8 App I will be developing requires a flat table database like NoSQL or in AWS case DynamoDB.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h4>Ok so this, but what exactly?</h4> <p>So had a brief look at what you get free, one micro instance but for my need I wanted a bit more grr, so have stumped up the cash(well have yet to really see how much) and have got two micro instance.</p> <p>Sadly I am a die hard windows fan loving my nice GUI’s rather than terminal, despite having used the powerful Ubuntu CVSSP servers I still for admin like windows. </p> <p>So what can you get? Windows Server, 2008, 2012 with all sorts on top. But what does it mean for CPU usage well 2008 clearly requires less processing power but how much? well about 40%.</p> <p>Windows Server 2012: Runing IIS</p> <p><a href="http://stuartjames.info/Journal/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/win2012_iis.png"><img style="display: inline" title="Win2012_IIS" alt="Win2012_IIS" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/win2012_iis_thumb.png" width="300" height="143"></a></p> <p>Windows Server 2008: Running SQL Express 08</p> <p><a href="http://stuartjames.info/Journal/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/win2008_sqlexpress.png"><img style="display: inline" title="Win2008_SQLExpress" alt="Win2008_SQLExpress" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/media/wlw/win2008_sqlexpress_thumb.png" width="300" height="144"></a></p> <p>Now although these two graphs are two different servers for different jobs, I would like to state this sort of behaviour for 2012 is indicative of a base line, barely getting close to 40%. So will probably need to rethink using 2012 for my web server.</p> <p>Having said all this though I did some experiments against my old VPS shared server, with 2GB ram running both Web and SQL Express and found the performance to be comparable. I also did some test on another MojoPortal website running on a shared hosting for a business account and was comparable with that too with 100ms difference in favour of the shared hosting but less of a connection scale problem.</p> <h4>So is it worth it?</h4> <p>Well it is hard to tell, I am going to do some tests for a month so I see what the real costs are because you ‘pay on a meter’ it could be more could be less than expected the IOPS factor is very hard to predict and I haven’t found any meaningful references to decide what is a real Windows server IOPS count on EBS storage.</p> <p>My main concern is the cost jump from a micro instance to a small, for a micro instance the cost being $14.28 for a small $84.18 just for an instance running 24hours a day of usage for 1 month.</p> <h4>What could be cool</h4> <p>At the moment I am running two micro instances one SQL one Web, but this is very easy to change up to a few instances running the data folder of MojoPortal against the S3 storage, with an Elastic Load Balancer(ELB) run on top of the Web servers could be a nice way of dynamically handling load with a low cost due to the micro instance. Using this style of solution is hard to judge with little to no real experience but seems logical.</p> <h4>To come</h4> <p>Well I have only been using AWS for a weekend will see what it comes to after a month with a couple of sites on it. Will get back to you soon!</p><br /><a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/looking-at-the-clouds-and-wondering-which-way-to-go.aspx'>Stuart James</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/looking-at-the-clouds-and-wondering-which-way-to-go.aspx'>...</a>

                    </header>
                    <section>
                        <p>Today I had an interesting problem, due to dumping a lot of data down onto SkyDrive my local updates are running a little behind. So when I was faced with writing up a presentation for the Post-Graduate Conference I hit a problem moving between devices. After considering my options of downloading manually and uploading the completed power point I saw an interesting experiment that I could do to test the Surface RT. I aim to answer the simple question of:</p>
<p><strong><em>Is it possible to write a presentation on your surface?</em></strong></p>
<p>So I started editing the presentation which I started on my laptop, then quickly realised touch doesn't work. This isn't a major objection since there is the option of a touch pad or a usb mouse. Since I had a mouse to hand decided to use that, I am sure you could use the touch-pad but I'll go the like of least resistance.</p>
<p>To note to make it even slightly possible to do a power point or any office task on the Surface RT you need to download all the updates from the desktop mode windows update. Without the updates it is practically unbearable to even type in Word. Since the updates were available before consumer release don't take this as a negative to the Surface RT.</p>
<p>There are a collection of constraints you must consider when using the surface deciding to use PowerPoint on windows rt. The big one is, have you got all your images you are going to need? If the answer to this is no, then you are doomed before you begin. With no good way really of editing images on the RT it really isn't possible to do. You of course have the basic options within PowerPoint like crop etc, but these wont go far in creating really technical drawings.</p>
<p>The problem of assets is somewhat relieved by SkyDrive and its wonderful integration with Office 2013, this allows you to quickly and easily pull down images or videos you need and dump them in. There are some UI niggles I have with this on how it interacts, for example when you insert an image if you quickly go back to the insert image icon it wont remember where you are in sSkydrive or even that you were using SkyDrive to start with it will bring your right back to where online do you want to get this image from.</p>
<p>Oddly other than the resource issue I didn't hit much more some nice things you can do with snapping to organise your thoughts with the one note app allows you to think another time and write up when you are ready as can be seen below:</p>
<p><img style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; display: block;" title="Power Point Windows RT" alt="Power Point Windows RT" src="http://stuartjames.info/Data/Sites/5/blogimages/powerpoint-rt/powerpoint_splitscreen.png" height="309" width="550" /></p>
<p> </p>
<p>So to answer the question, Yes it is possible but you must come prepared. I found myself having to go back to my desktop that I was sat in front of to shorten some videos and create some new images. The missing assets could of been dropped and would be a reasonable presentation, but with presentations unless you are a seasoned veteran it is unlikely you will be happy to go with a presentation that is "reasonable".</p>
<p>Having said all this if you are sure you have everything you need then jump on the train and you could put together and present (if you have a VGA accessory) when you get there without a problem!</p>
<p>I think this was a nice win for the Surface RT!</p>
