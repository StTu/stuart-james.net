            <p>So earlier this week I had a little problem with Apache/PHP killing the task I had running. So after looking around a little online I got some hints and finally came to the conclusion on this line:</p><pre class="brush: c-sharp; showcolumns: true">echo exec(sprintf("rsh [server] 'nohup %s &gt; %s 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp; echo $! &gt; %s'", 
  "/usr/bin/python2.7 [python script]", 
  "[log file]", 
  "[pid id file]"));
</pre>

<p>Something to remember, of course this is for Linux</p><br /><a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/running-a-process-in-the-background-from-php.aspx'>Stuart James</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href='http://stuartjames.info/Journal/running-a-process-in-the-background-from-php.aspx'>...</a>

                        <p>2013 I really found my stride with audiobooks, having started the year previous I listened got through a collection of books averaging one complete book a month for the year. This may not seem like much, I know a lot of people read a book a week or even a night, but for me this a dramatic jump on probably one every 3-4 years. </p><p>I thought I would try to highlight some of the books I enjoyed reading and would recommend to anyone with similar interests to me that is interested in reading a little more</p><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">

This was a relaxing read with somewhat of a story to string it all together; making it a lot more casual than a lot of Psychology books.</td>

                    <section>
                        <p>For a research project we are working with peoples Facebook data amongst other social data, this required writing an application to inspect user content utilising the public API. This process shone some light on the privacy of Facebook. A lot of stories in recent years have focused primarily on how Facebook changes its privacy settings but not enough has been focused on the vulnerability of apps to the privacy intentions of the user.</p>
<p>To give you an understanding I though I would work through an example of how you can easily create an app and access more than probably expected about your data and your friends. To note before anyone complains I realise that you are required to install the application for it to have any meaning, but I will give an example of where what happens is not possibly what you would expect to counter this.</p>
<p>During testing of our app for the project a collection of colleagues installed a test version to make sure when used in the wild it would perform as expected. A user had their privacy settings so that friends of the user could not see the their friends unless they were in common. This I am sure is common for a lot of people on Facebook, what happened with the app though is it got full access to her friends list, now may sound strange to highlight this since it asked for permission to do this, but when you consider that this user is sharing more with a random installed app than with their actual friends? I am doubtful this is was what was originally intended by this user.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the example. This is worked through using Facebook Developer interface with <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/php/">Facebook PHP SDK</a>.</p>
<p>The Facebook API is incredible simple but also incredible confusing at the same time -- what you would expect from a major corporation’s software.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So I will break this down into several steps that I will cover over a series of articles in general I will try to address 2 aspects per article:</p>
<ol><li>Authenticating a user / Getting them to install your app</li><li>What the app can see of my feed</li><li>What the app can see of my friends</li><li>Photos galore</li><li>Having some fun with the API</li><li>The monkey in the closet</li></ol>
<p>A couple of notes on what this will tell you how to do and what it wont. I am writing this app as an external entity to Facebook and less intended to be nested into the Facebook site via their canvas approach. To achieve a nested app you will probably want to do things a little different and probably exploit javascript.</p>
<h4>1. Authenticating a user / Getting them to install your app</h4>
<p>Facebook apps are simple to write once you get a handle on the paths required is simple to adjust to do more. So to get someone to install your app you need a link[Ref: Facebook PHP SDK examples].</p>
<p>To get started, you need to direct the perspective user to Facebook</p>
<p>Firstly create an object with your app credentials and see if you have a user, this follows SDK example</p>
<pre class="brush: php; toolbar: false">require 'api/utils/facebook.php';
$facebook = new Facebook(array(
  'appId'  =&gt; 'xxxx',
  'secret' =&gt; 'xxxx',
));
$user = $facebook-&gt;getUser();
if ($user) {
  try {
    // Proceed knowing you have a logged in user who's authenticated.
    $user_profile = $facebook-&gt;api('/me');
  } catch (FacebookApiException $e) {
    error_log($e);
    $user = null;
  }
}</pre>
<p>Now you can either do something with the $user or detect NULL and push them to add your app</p>
<pre class="brush: php; toolbar: false">if ($user) {
  $_GET["id"] = $user_profile['id'];
  $logoutUrl = $facebook-&gt;getLogoutUrl();
} else {
  $statusUrl = $facebook-&gt;getLoginStatusUrl();
  $pageURL = 'http';
  if ($_SERVER["HTTPS"] == "on") {$pageURL .= "s";}
  $pageURL .= "://";
  if ($_SERVER["SERVER_PORT"] != "80") {
    $pageURL .= $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"].":".$_SERVER["SERVER_PORT"].$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
  } else {
    $pageURL .= $_SERVER["SERVER_NAME"].$_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"];
  }

</pre>
